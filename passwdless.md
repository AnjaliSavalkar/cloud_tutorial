Certainly! Here's a **ready-to-use GitHub-style documentation** (`README.md`) for setting up **passwordless SSH authentication**. You can copy this into a GitHub repo to document your setup or project.

## 🔐 Passwordless SSH Authentication Setup

This guide helps you configure **passwordless SSH login** from your **local machine (e.g., WSL/Ansible controller)** to a **remote machine** (e.g., AWS EC2, local VM).

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

* SSH installed on both local and remote machines
* Remote machine accessible via IP or hostname
* User account on remote machine (e.g., `ubuntu`, `root`)
* (Optional) `.pem` key for initial connection (for EC2 or VMs)

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

### 🔹 1. Generate SSH Key Pair

On your **local machine**:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

* Press `Enter` at each prompt to accept the default path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
* This creates:

  * Private Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  * Public Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

---

### 🔹 2. Copy Public Key to Remote Machine

#### ✅ Option A: Using `ssh-copy-id` (Preferred)

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@remote_ip
```

**Example:**

```bash
ssh-copy-id ubuntu@192.168.56.101
```

This appends your public key to the remote file: `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

#### 🔧 Option B: Manual (if `ssh-copy-id` is not available)

```bash
ssh -i awskey.pem ubuntu@remote_ip "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i awskey.pem ubuntu@remote_ip "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

---

### 🔹 3. Test Passwordless Login

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.56.101
```

You should log in without being asked for a password or `.pem` file.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

* File permissions on remote:

  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

* SSH agent setup:

  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

* Ensure public key exists:

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
